# odin-recipes
This is my first project showcasing the basic HTML I have learnt. This project
is a recipe website, showing multiple easy to make recipes for students on a
budget. 

I wanted to make this project so I can utilize the skills I have learnt so far
in HTML. This project shows skills such as:

- Absolute and relative links

- Ordered and unordered lists

- Bold and italic text using strong and em

- Anchor element

- Images with alt text

- Different types of headers.
